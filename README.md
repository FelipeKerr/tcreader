# tcreader

A terminal comic reader written in C++

## Story

I wanted a terminal comic reader, but none were available, so I made one in C++ with the help of AI.

## Requirements

- Works best in terminal emulators that can render images, such as Kitty and Ghostty.
- C++17 compatible compiler.

## Configuration

'tcreader' supports a config file: '~/.tcreader.conf'
example content:
library = /path/to/comic_folder

## Usage
Run the program from the terminal:
```bash
```bash
./tcreader path/to/comic.cbr
```
